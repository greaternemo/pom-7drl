POM.js - main game file, framework init
Nautilus.js - framework core, init logic

Registries contain keyed information?

Engine: STOP USING ENGINE, JUST STOP
Too much conflicting information.

Let's talk about... usage frequency.
What will we use the most?
What will we interact with the most?

We have the part where everything originates,
from which we initialize everything on load.
We have the application, which contains all
the process logic and IO systems and really
everything that we stand up in the init step.
In the application, we have the core logic,
which arranges and conducts everything in
the application.
The core logic manages the game and all the
related systems and processes.
At the bottom, really, is the game itself.
The game is not the loop, the loop is just
one part of the game as a whole within the
application.

At the top is our application.
The init logic in the application fires up all of our
basic systems, and each layer builds on the last.
Next come the most basic of systems:
data registry,
signal router,
object factory,
application manager.
Off of those are built the core interface systems:
view manager,
input manager.
Then we have the different bits accessible from within
the application:
menu logic,
game logic.
The game proper is a construct that resides within the
application and contains all the systems that come
together to make "the game" as it's played:
game manager
action manager
world manager
