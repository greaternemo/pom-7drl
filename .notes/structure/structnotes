data-driven programming:
define selection criteria for the data you want,
then perform operations on it 

Any core structure objects will be created and be assigned
to attributes of larger constructs.
Any state data required by those constructs internally will
be assigned to attributes of those constructs as well.
The data registry will hold the data for and references to
ALL DATA EXCEPT:
The greater application (aka the top level namespace)

Should all locations be unique?
Based on the Space/Location model you've put together,
I don't see how they couldn't be unique?

REMEMBER REMEMBER REMEMBER
The relationship between physical locations REQUIRES
all location abstractions to be unique because together,
all location abstractions will form a contiguous map of
multiple dimensions. Stop thinking in terms of traditional
concepts like "floors" and "rooms". Those are details, not
constructs in and of themselves.
Fucking brilliant, mate.
