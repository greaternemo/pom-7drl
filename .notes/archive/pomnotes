Shit that still needs to be done:

Rework the game state data from the POM.Player class into the GameEngine or something
Rework all the player handling logic from the ActEngine into generic mob handling logic
Implement pathfinding for mobs
    For shadows, they will be unaware of the player by default but will become aware under
    specific circumstances? If a player picks up their orb or something or gets too close?
    Shadows need a condition in which they will pursue the player. I probably need to
    implement A* or something for pathfinding
Update meditation logic so you can only meditate in empty rooms (for testing)
Update combat logic so any orbs on your person are destroyed if you fight (lol)
Figure out how to make the classes distinct if that's how you want to do it
Look at how you're calling data from each class to try to reduce dependency on globals

Dependencies & Inheritance revamp brainstorm:

entities, components, systems
an entity just holds components
components hold data
systems handle entities based on game events and components

name scheme:
eName: engines
sName: systems
rName: registries
cName: components
tName: things?

What registries do I need?
All registries
All entities
All zones in POM.eView (gameplay)
All nodes/zones in gameplay (floor, minimap, stats, text)
All nodes/zones in floor (5x5 rooms)
All nodes/zones in minimap (6x6 doors, 5x5 rooms)
All nodes/zones in stats (health, understanding, items)
All nodes in text (5x??? chars)
All nodes in all 5 rooms ()

Program flow:
Init game
Generate lib entries
Generate engines
Populate game engine
